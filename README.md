# Dust Modelling

This package is a work-in-progress toolkit designed for astrophysics and astronomy research, with a focus on the interactions between starlight and dust. The package is modular, allowing researchers to utilize individual components as needed. Key features include:

## Stellar Flux Modelling: 
Utilizes the Castelli-Kurucz stellar model to extract and analyze stellar flux measurements.

## Dust Interaction Modelling: 

Integrates models such as the Draine Infrared Emission Model and the Astrodust Models (Hensley and Draine 2022) to study the interaction of starlight with interstellar or circumstellar dust, and the resulting infrared radiation emitted by the dust.

## Data IO & Visualization: 

Offers tools for interfacing with various data formats and visualizing the modeled interactions and emissions.
