# Dust Modelling Toolkit

This package is an evolving toolkit designed for astrophysicsresearch, focusing on the interactions between stellar light and dust particles in space. The toolkit is built with modularity in mind, allowing researchers to utilize individual components as needed to fit their specific research goals.

## Features

### Stellar Flux Modelling
- **Model Integration**: Leverages the Castelli-Kurucz stellar models to analyze and interpret stellar flux measurements effectively.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides tools for extracting and processing stellar data to study its impact on dust.

### Dust Interaction Modelling
- **Advanced Modelling**: Incorporates comprehensive models such as the Draine Infrared Emission Model and the Astrodust Models by Hensley and Draine (2022).
- **Interaction Analysis**: Simulates and analyzes the interaction between stellar light and interstellar/circumstellar dust, focusing on the resulting infrared emissions.
- **Parameter Optimization**: Includes functionality to perform chi-square tests over a grid of model parameters, facilitating the precise fitting of models to observational data.

### Data I/O and Visualization
- **Data Handling**: Supports various data formats, providing robust tools for data import and export tailored to the needs of astrophysical research.
- **Visualization Tools**: Offers advanced visualization options to graphically represent data and modelling results, enhancing the interpretability and presentation of research findings.
